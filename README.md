# Game of pong
This project implements a Pong game with an added twist: both the human player and the AI agent have a health pool (HP) that decreases whenever they move their paddle. This mechanic encourages players (human and AI alike) to make more strategic, efficient movements rather than simply matching the ball's vertical position at all times. First player to reach the set number of points (or force the other player to deplete their HP) wins.
Three Difficulty Levels
- Easy
- Medium
- Hard
Each difficulty changes the ballâ€™s speed, providing different levels of challenge for the human player.
